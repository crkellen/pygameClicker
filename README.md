# pygameClicker
A simple clicker game made with the pygame library to learn Python.
#### **IMPORTANT:** This was made with Python 3.5.3, and as such MAY only run with that version (it might run on other versions).
#### It will also require that you install the correct version of pygame hosted here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
#### YOU MUST CHOOSE THE pygame-1.9.3-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl FILE. Install it according to the instructions here: https://www.webucator.com/blog/2015/03/installing-the-windows-64-bit-version-of-pygame/
Run the program by typing "python clicker.py" into your command line in the correct directory.

EDIT 2024-05-12: These links seem out of date now. You should still be able to download pygame from https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
You'll need the [1.9.3 version](https://pypi.python.org/packages/61/06/3c25051549c252cc6fde01c8aeae90b96831370884504fe428a623316def/pygame-1.9.3.tar.gz#md5=ac744ea6952b68d5f2b6d02a6d8e836c).
