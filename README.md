# pygameClicker
A simple clicker game made with the pygame library to learn Python.
#### **IMPORTANT:** This was made with Python 3.5.3, and as such MAY only run with that version (it might run on other versions).
#### It will also require that you install the correct version of pygame hosted here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
#### YOU MUST CHOOSE THE pygame-1.9.3-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl FILE. Install it according to the instructions here: https://www.webucator.com/blog/2015/03/installing-the-windows-64-bit-version-of-pygame/
Run the program by typing "python clicker.py" into your command line in the correct directory.
